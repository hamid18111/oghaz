            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Principal Research Scientist with over a decade of experience in designing, developing, and deploying machine learning and computer vision solutions to extract and study clinically relevant biomarkers that can aid in diagnostic and treatment planning of various diseases. I have collaborated with interdisciplinary teams, including clinicians, engineers, regulatory experts, and industry partners to translate research findings into products, ready to be used in clinical practice. My recent work at Exactech includes developing and integrating an automated cloud-based surgical outcome prediction model that utilizes muscle and bone radiomics to predict range of motion and pain. I have worked with various images modalities including CT, MRI, and angiography scans in cardiovascular and musculoskeletal domains. Previously, I worked as research faculty in the Department of Neurosurgery at the Buffalo University and have published extensively in vascular and orthopedic fields.</p>
